            <p>Hunter Searches for answers for problems so vast that normal computer search methods canâ€™t find
              an solution in a reasonable time - or maybe ever.</p>
            <p>
              A few examples:
            <ul>
              <li> Medical: A better material replacement for knee cartiledge. This is in the area of Material
                Science. Computers might try to assemble atoms and molecules for a material safe amongst the 300 types of cells
                in the human body yet has all the characteristics for elasticity, hardness, etc. needed.</li>
              <li> BioMedical research and areas such as Stem Cell Research, Cancer, or Viruses. </li>
                <li>Many problems are multi-part: first you must find a physical structure and
                then find a way to manufacture it.  Hunter can work simultaneously on both the product and the manufacturing.
              </li>
              <li> Predicting weather - <b>accurately</b>. Though a lot of work has gone into improving weather
                prediction over the years, it still has room for a lot of improvement.
              </li>
              <li> Disease Control - range from the common cold, flu, HIV, heart disease, and cancer.
              </li>
              <li> Financial Investment strategies. This is an area where computers are already controlling large
                portfolios and competing against other computers.
              </li>
            </ul>
